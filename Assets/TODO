TODO:



- Game goal => Collect as much art as possible => more achievements


Buildings:
-) Buildings to be constructed => Military, Universal Farming - Warehouse (Based on closest general material), School builiding, Relaxing building (consumes material, increases hapiness), Food building 


- Military building =>  Assign
- School building =>



Materials:
- They are => Gold ( => Good for Law + Art generation), Art, Food (brings more happiness to the population), Wood (if collected at a high level => Affect the nature> bring down happiness > Good for Building production, Upgrade Cards) 
- Limited amount, decrease animation => DO NOT DESTROY, HIDE!



Global variables => no local, only loco 

-variables: 
 - All Materials
 - Agreement/Stability => ( countSimilarity(poliical axis variables constraints, current axis variables constraints) / all variables) => influence production (highest weight)
- might or battle power per pop => increases per militant pop given more assigned to military building 
- Happiness => Increases if agreement high(threshold) (weights the most), increases if food high (second ), increases from the relaxing building.  (third)
            => Decrease => agreemnt + food low + amount of people being killed in fights and type of mob
            => influence => All productions + might + birth rate
- Art experience accumulation + art multiplier based on mobs assigned to MainBuild. Can be increaesd by learning at schools.  => XP calculation = multiplier * number of mobs assigned to mainBuild 
- Birth rate => Increase change to spawn mob 
- Work power => increase if high number of persons work, but drastically decrease if no material available and many work. (Though about more, Ask Gemini)
- Population Count => Decrease food per total population => tick time on food decreasal (depends on population count) 
- Building count => Agreement increase/decrease 





- Laws are multipliers on top of the allready existing variables 

- Upgrade card => Ups mob capacity for each building + multiplier on the specific building type of material collector 

art generation

Neutral => Distribute:




-) Faces and models of the people  
- (Optional) => Regarding amount of happiness (0 - 1 value) => faces change 
-) Text bubble + audio sync from the people behind  
-) Upgrade the tiles visually.
-) (Optional) => Upgrade the panels texture wise.


-) Modify the Mob class to be more flexible => Military, 
-) Mob selection not via gaze + pinch => But touch (tapping)
-) No rotation for the card on hand
-) Enemy mobs appearing  => Mob goes forward + tile check per each tile encountered => If end reached, move towards mainbuild by difference in tile (x,y coordinate) 
-) Mobs spawn by themselves, calculated by fertility rate => interconnected with the happiness factor
-) Mobs assigned to the mainbuilding are generating art (When spawned, mob allready assigned to be art slave => mainbuilding)
-) Assign mobs to school in order to upgrade the productivity rate of the art 
-) Level up by collecting art => level bar reach max => spawn painting on the wall that reflects the current situation regarding the stats => boost (negative/positive)
-) Random mob spawned + low probability (10%)  selection to be killed given below happiness threshold (Checked every seconds)
-) If mob assigned to tile => Remove Current Building Assignment + assign to military building 


-) Lights effects + Paintings boost given Agreement.   (LATER regarding painting boost)

-) Given battle between mobs and enemy mobs IN A SPECIFIC TILE => result = might power your mobs - might power enemy mobs => if negative, all of your mobs die + from enemy mobs die  mobs that accumulate result power + The other way around => prioritize killing the weaker ones




-) Because of the demo => Show the desire. 





Eduard:

-) Mob selection not via gaze + pinch => But touch (tapping)
-) No rotation for the card on hand
-) Enemy mobs appearing  => Mob goes forward + tile check per each tile encountered => If end reached, move towards mainbuild by difference in tile (x,y coordinate) 
-) AR => Identify Flat surface => Creating table + painting placeholder
-)

Tasks regarding People behind you: 









Tasks later on:

- Point selection for mobs instead of gaze + pinch




Plan!
TODO a-d + Issues to be solved until Monday
