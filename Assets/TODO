Issues:
a) MainBuilding constantly changing size because I'm changing the prefab size (incorrect)                                           (x)
b) Spawned mobs should NEVER change y-axis after spawning                                                                           (x)
c) spawned object doesn't precisely go at the target object. (optional for now)                                                  (optional for now)



TODO:
a) Fix issues                                                                                                                       (All excluding the optional one)
b) Create materials to be randomly placed on the plane => Cannot build on those tiles!                                              (x)
c) Materials glow or make the material/plane more distinct. 
b) Mobs and other buidlings relation interchangeability
d) Mineral collecter
e) Enemy mobs appearing and prioritizing buildings, but also attack mobs



Plan!
TODO a-d + Issues to be solved until Monday
